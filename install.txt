To install React.js on Ubuntu, you'll need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

Update your system's package index:
sudo apt update


Install Node.js and npm:
sudo apt install nodejs npm

Verify the installation by checking the Node.js and npm versions:
node -v
npm -v

Create a new directory for your React.js project:
mkdir react-app
cd react-app

Initialize a new npm project:
npm init -y


Install React and React DOM packages:
npm install react react-dom

Install Create React App globally (optional):
lua

sudo npm install -g create-react-app

Creating new app:
create-react-app tecmint-app

Installing Create React App globally allows you to quickly scaffold new React.js projects. You can skip this step if you prefer to use npx instead.

Create a new React.js project:
lua

npx create-react-app my-react-app

Replace "my-react-app" with the desired name for your project.

Change into the project directory:
cd my-react-app

Start the development server:
npm start

This command will compile your React.js code and launch a development server. You can access your React application by opening your browser and visiting http://localhost:3000.

That's it! You have successfully installed React.js and created a new React application on your Ubuntu system. Now you can start building your React components and explore the wonderful world of React.js development.
